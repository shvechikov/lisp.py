# LISP -> LISP -> Python

It is a little experiment that was done during reading [The Roots of LISP][1] —
a great article by Paul Graham.

The challenge was to create a basic LISP interpreter in Python and then —
as a proof of the completeness — test it by running classical LISP in LISP
implementaion.

You can run the tests by calling:

    $ make test
